Burger Shop App Proposal

I have developed a burger shop app that allows users to place orders and view order summaries. Here are the key features of the app:

Input Fields: The app includes a total of 9 input fields, categorized into 4 different types of input controls. These fields are designed to gather relevant information from the user for placing an order.

Activity Structure: The app consists of 3 activities. The first activity collects user input data for placing an order. The second activity displays a summary of the user's order. Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties with the database aspect of the code, the third activity, which was meant to show the total number of orders placed, had to be removed.

Button Functionality: The first activity contains three buttons. The first button allows the user to submit their order, while the second button resets all the input fields in case the user changes their mind. The third button, although not currently connected to any functionality, was intended to display a previous order based on the order's name.

Background Images: The app incorporates two different background images that correspond to the different activities. These images enhance the visual appeal and provide a visually distinct experience for the users.

Data Persistence: To ensure a seamless user experience, the app saves the data entered by the user even if the application is rotated. This feature allows users to continue their order without losing any progress.

Please note that while the app has been developed with these features, there were challenges with the database aspect, which caused the app to crash. As a result, the database functionality was temporarily removed. Future improvements will be made to address this issue and potentially reintroduce the third activity and its intended functionality.
